# RememberMyDrive
Remember my drive is a simple project that allow you to remember always your drive before leaving your PC.

## How it works?

It's simple! After you opened the program, it will be display on the System Tray with a little black icon. That's it! By clicking on the icon a message will appear indicating the number of drives connected and, if you shutdown/logoff from your session, the program is capable of "stop" the processo remembering you that there are drives still connected.

## Why?

In the past few months I used lots of computers in different places, with always my little USB drive with me. Sometimes, because I was late or something else, I just forgive them to the computer. You can imagine the frustration while looking on the bag for the drive.
So this is why I created RememberMyDrive. A simple code, written in just 2 hours, for "stop" the Windows shutdown/logoff if a USB drive is connected. 
Some people may ask how I "stop" the shutdown/logoff process. It's fairly simple: basically, a MessageBox can stop the shutdown or logoff because it's waiting a response from the user. Until you don't close the app or the messagebox, the system will be locked.
